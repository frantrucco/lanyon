My name is Francisco Trucco.  
I am an undergraduate student in *Computer Science* at the [Facultad de Matemática, Astronomía, Física y Computación](http://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/) at **Universidad Nacional De Córdoba**.  
I made this blog to take notes about many different topics of computer science (hopefully) that I decided to learn about.  
The posts range from opinions about programming languages and editors to detailed explanations of algorithms.
